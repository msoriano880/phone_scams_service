# phone_scams_service

Tools used for this project:
a. puppeteer 
b. express
c. mongoose
d. socket.io

The project runs using npm start.

At this stage when the user enters a phone number it will simply return a message "TRUSTED" or "NOT TRUSTED". 
This will be improved soon by returning more details of the said number to the user.

The chat feature allows the users to communicate their concerns and experiences regarding phone scams.
The same will also be improved soon by adding a video chat so they can see whom they are talking too.

At the moment the database contains only few data to test the phone number functionality. It should be improved by adding more data and create a scraper that updates the data to the database everytime the website updates.
